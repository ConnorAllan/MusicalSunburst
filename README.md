For our final project in CS 205, we have choosen to create, design and implement a program that will display a music database in a graphical way on a web server. To accomplish this, we are utilizing [Django(2.1.7) as our framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/overview/) and [D3 Sunburst Charts](https://bl.ocks.org/vasturiano/12da9071095fbd4df434e60d52d2d58d) as our graphical display. The database will be hosted via the SQLite3 database that accompanies the Django framework.

https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/csv/music/music.html -- Derived datased based on previous option, appears to be more in line with our size constraints and our goals for content.
