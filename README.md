# MusicalSunburst
CS 205 Final Project
Connor Allan, Jack Houk, Jake Liu, Shravya Suddala


For our final project, we chose to program with Python using Django as our web framework. We have chosen to use mySQL to create our database. We decided to make a website that hosts our database of songs using a dataset that includes url, week_ID, ranking, song_ID, songs, artists, years, youtube link, genre. We hope to sort this database by year or genre as well as visually see in a timeline format what genre was popular a certain year. We have yet to decide on how we will visualize our data but we are leaning towards a sunburst chart. An example of the sunburst chart can be found here: (https://bl.ocks.org/vasturiano/12da9071095fbd4df434e60d52d2d58d).

We have selected three potential data sources, we will make final decisions based on which offers the most interesting and engaging options for data presentation. They are as follows

https://data.world/kcmillersean/billboard-hot-100-1958-2017 -- Popular songs offer good selection criteria but there is not much info about them here. Would likely need to supplement with additional data.)

https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/ -- Very detailed, very large, may have unnecessary information, need to investigate selection criteria.

https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/csv/music/music.html -- Derived datased based on previous option, appears to be more in line with our size constraints and our goals for content.

Our preliminary UI design is presented on the following page.
