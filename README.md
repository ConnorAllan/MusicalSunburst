For our final project in CS 205, we have choosen to create, design and implement a program that will display a music database in a graphical way on a web server. To accomplish this, we are utilizing [Django(2.1.7) as our framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/overview/) and [D3 Sunburst Charts](https://bl.ocks.org/vasturiano/12da9071095fbd4df434e60d52d2d58d) as our graphical display. The database will be hosted via the SQLite3 database that accompanies the Django framework.


We have selected three potential data sources, we will make final decisions based on which offers the most interesting and engaging options for data presentation. They are as follows

https://data.world/kcmillersean/billboard-hot-100-1958-2017 -- Popular songs offer good selection criteria but there is not much info about them here. Would likely need to supplement with additional data.)

https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/ -- Very detailed, very large, may have unnecessary information, need to investigate selection criteria.

https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/csv/music/music.html -- Derived datased based on previous option, appears to be more in line with our size constraints and our goals for content.
